This work presents a novel hybrid methodology that integrates Constraint Programming (CP), optimization techniques, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to address the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP). The proposed solution combines Google OR-Tools, guided local search algorithms, constructive heuristics, and automated classification through SVM to generate high-quality solutions. Experimental validation, conducted on 19 MDVRP instances sourced from the Kaggle repository and academic literature, confirms the effectiveness of the hybrid approach, showing significant improvements in both total distance minimization and computational efficiency compared to conventional approaches.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Introduction to Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) and Multi-Depot VRP (MDVRP)}
The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) represents a fundamental challenge in combinatorial optimization and integer programming, aiming to determine the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods or services to a predefined set of customers \cite{toth2014vehicle}. This problem, which historically emerged as the "truck dispatching problem" described by George Dantzig and John Ramser in 1959 \cite{dantzig1959truck}, has been a cornerstone in logistics and supply chain research. The VRP is a generalization of the classic Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), where a single vehicle must visit all locations and return to the starting point \cite{pelsmaeker2019or}.

Both the TSP and VRP are classified as NP-hard problems, implying that the computational effort to find an optimal solution grows exponentially with the problem size. This characteristic makes exhaustive search infeasible for most practical instances \cite{pelsmaeker2019or}. Consequently, the inherent intractability of these problems has driven the development of approximation methods. The primary objective of VRPs is often the minimization of total travel distance or cost, but it can also include minimizing the number of vehicles, total travel time, or maximizing customer satisfaction \cite{toth2014vehicle}. Real-world VRPs often incorporate various constraints, such as vehicle capacity limits (weight, volume), time windows for deliveries, and maximum route lengths \cite{pelsmaeker2019or}.

The Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP) represents a significant extension of the classic VRP, addressing scenarios where vehicles operate from multiple depots to serve a set of customers \cite{crevier2007vehicle}. In this variant, each vehicle starts from a specific depot, serves its assigned customers, and returns to the same depot \cite{cordeau1997tabu}. The MDVRP is also an NP-hard problem, adding complexity by requiring simultaneous decisions on both customer-to-depot assignment and vehicle routing \cite{cordeau1997tabu}. A common strategy to address the MDVRP is the "cluster first, route second" approach, where customers are initially assigned to depots (clustering) and then routes are determined for each depot \cite{ho2008hybrid}.

\subsection{MDVRP in Dynamic and Stochastic Environments}
Traditional VRPs often assume static environments where all problem data (customer locations, demands, travel times) are known in advance and remain constant \cite{oyola2021recent}. However, real-world logistics, particularly in unpredictable scenarios, often involve dynamic and stochastic elements \cite{gendreau1996stochastic}. Stochastic VRPs address uncertainties in problem parameters, such as stochastic demands or travel times \cite{laporte2002vehicle}. Dynamic VRPs (DVRPs) involve information that changes or becomes known during the planning horizon, requiring real-time adaptation and re-optimization \cite{gendreau1996stochastic}.

A critical application area for MDVRP in stochastic and dynamic environments is disaster relief logistics \cite{yu2020multi}. Disasters such as earthquakes can severely compromise road networks, introducing stochastic road conditions. In these contexts, objectives extend beyond monetary cost to include time efficiency, equity, and reliability \cite{lei2015risk}. The focus of this paper on the "Multi-Depot Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem with Stochastic Road Conditions" (MDDVRPSRC) directly addresses these complex challenges, seeking to optimize routing in scenarios with unpredictable failures \cite{yu2020multi}.

\subsection{Motivation and Contributions}
This research is motivated by the need for robust and efficient solutions to complex, real-world routing problems, especially those characterized by uncertainty and dynamism. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid architecture that combines Constraint Programming (CP), local search heuristics, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The fundamental contributions of this research include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Development of a hybrid CP-Optimization-SVM framework for MDVRP under stochastic conditions.
    \item Innovative integration of SVM for intelligent route classification to guide the search process.
    \item Implementation using Google OR-Tools with guided local search algorithms.
    \item Exhaustive experimental validation on 19 benchmark instances simulating post-disaster scenarios.
    \item Detailed comparative analysis demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
\end{enumerate}

\section{State of the Art: Optimization and Learning Paradigms}

The NP-hard nature of the VRP and its variants has been the fundamental driver for the development of approximate solution methods. Research has focused on heuristic, metaheuristic, and, more recently, learning-based optimization approaches.

\subsection{Constraint Programming (CP) in VRP}
Constraint Programming (CP) is a powerful paradigm for representing and solving a wide range of combinatorial problems \cite{laborie2018ibm}. It involves defining variables, their domains, and intricate constraints they must satisfy. In the VRP context, CP is highly effective for flexibly modeling complex constraints such as vehicle capacities, route lengths, customer demands, and time windows \cite{shaw1998using}. While CP can find optimal solutions, its computational time for large problems can be prohibitive when used as a standalone search method \cite{demassey2006metaheuristic}. Therefore, CP is often integrated into hybrid methodologies, where its primary role shifts from direct search to solution validation and ensuring constraint satisfaction \cite{laborie2007solving}.

\subsection{Heuristic and Metaheuristic Approaches}
\subsubsection{Constructive Heuristics}
These methods build a feasible initial solution from scratch. Examples include the Clarke \& Wright savings algorithm \cite{cordeau1997tabu}. This paper specifically uses "PATH\_CHEAPEST\_ARC" as a constructive heuristic to generate a feasible initial solution, providing a starting point for further optimization.

\subsubsection{Local Search and Guided Local Search (GLS)}
Local search techniques iteratively improve an existing solution by exploring its neighborhood \cite{pisinger2007general}. However, simple local search can get trapped in suboptimal solutions. Guided Local Search (GLS) is a metaheuristic designed to overcome this by penalizing certain solution features to diversify the search, encouraging exploration of new areas of the solution space.

\subsubsection{Population-Based Metaheuristics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Genetic Algorithms (GA):} Inspired by natural selection, GAs evolve a population of solutions over generations, using operators like crossover and mutation to find optimal or near-optimal solutions \cite{potvin1995genetic}.
    \item \textbf{Simulated Annealing (SA):} SA explores the solution space by probabilistically accepting "worse" solutions at higher "temperatures," allowing it to escape local optima \cite{lin2007efficient}.
    \item \textbf{Ant Colony Optimization (ACO):} This swarm intelligence metaheuristic is inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It has been successfully applied to numerous VRP variants \cite{dorigo2004ant}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Google OR-Tools: A Platform for Vehicle Routing}
Google OR-Tools is an open-source, general-purpose optimization suite that provides a high-level interface for solving a wide range of Vehicle Routing Problems \cite{google_or_tools}. Its routing solver is organized into three parts: first-solution heuristics, local search with metaheuristics for improvement, and a CP engine to prove optimality or further refine solutions \cite{pelsmaeker2019or}. Its ability to provide high-quality, near-optimal solutions makes it a valuable tool for both industrial applications and research.

\subsection{Integration of Machine Learning in VRP}
\subsubsection{Support Vector Machines (SVM)}
SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm primarily used for classification and regression tasks \cite{cortes1995support}. Its core principle involves finding the optimal "hyperplane" that best separates different classes in the data by maximizing the margin between the hyperplane and the nearest data points (support vectors) \cite{vapnik2000nature}. In the VRP context, this paper uses an SVM model "trained to classify the efficiency of routes based on various features," allowing the system to intelligently guide the local search process by prioritizing promising avenues and discarding less efficient ones, a concept explored in related research \cite{sindhwani2023novel, kandula2021systematic}.

\subsubsection{Emerging ML Techniques: RL and GNNs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reinforcement Learning (RL):} RL trains agents to find near-optimal VRP solutions by observing reward signals, without needing pre-solved instances. It is particularly advantageous for dynamic and large-scale scenarios \cite{gupta2022enhanced}.
    \item \textbf{Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):} GNNs are increasingly used for VRPs due to their ability to leverage the inherent graph structure of routing problems, learning feature representations of nodes and edges \cite{bi2024learning}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Proposed Methodology}

Our approach proposes a hybrid architecture that synergistically combines CP, optimization heuristics, and SVM, implemented on the Google OR-Tools platform, to solve the MDVRP under stochastic conditions.

\subsection{Overview of the Proposed Hybrid Framework}
The framework fuses Constraint Programming (CP) for robust constraint modeling, optimization techniques (specifically Guided Local Search - GLS) for iterative improvement, and Machine Learning (Support Vector Machines - SVM) for intelligent guidance. CP is used to flexibly model the intricate constraints of the MDVRP. A feasible initial solution is generated using a constructive heuristic, "PATH\_CHEAPEST\_ARC." GLS is then employed to iteratively improve this solution, with the novel integration of an SVM model trained to classify route efficiency. This SVM guides the GLS process, prioritizing promising solution pathways and enabling the metaheuristic to focus its computational effort on more fruitful areas.

\subsection{Mathematical Formulation of the MDVRP}
The MDVRP can be formulated on a complete graph $G = (V, A)$ where $V = D \cup C$ is the set of depot ($D$) and customer ($C$) nodes. The objective is to minimize the total cost:
\begin{align}
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{i \in V} \sum_{j \in V} \sum_{k \in K} c_{ij} x_{ijk} \label{eq:objective}
\end{align}
where $x_{ijk}$ is a binary variable indicating if vehicle $k$ travels from node $i$ to $j$. This is subject to main constraints ensuring each customer is visited once, flow continuity is maintained, each vehicle serves from one depot, and vehicle capacities are not exceeded.

\subsection{Architecture of the Hybrid CP-SVM Framework}
The approach consists of the following modules:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Preprocessing and Assignment:} Customers are clustered to the nearest depot under capacity constraints.
    \item \textbf{Optimization with OR-Tools:} Each cluster is treated as a CVRP subproblem solved using CP.
    \item \textbf{Machine Learning (SVM):} An SVM model is trained to classify routes as efficient or inefficient based on features like length, number of nodes, and dispersion. This classification guides the local search.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\section{Implementation and Experimental Setup}

\section{Experimental Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Performance and Comparative Analysis}
The experimental results are highly compelling (Table \ref{tab:main_results}). The hybrid method achieved an average reduction of 13.6\% in total travel distance compared to conventional methods. It also demonstrated a remarkable 66.9\% improvement in convergence speed. The SVM classifier itself showed a high accuracy of 94.1% in identifying efficient routes, validating its effectiveness.

\end{tabular}

\end{table}

A comparative analysis with other established methods for solving MDVRP, such as GA, SA, and ACO, consistently showed that the CP-SVM hybrid framework outperformed these alternatives in both solution quality and computational time (Table \ref{tab:state_of_art_comparison}). The predictive capability of the SVM directly enhances the efficiency of the metaheuristic. By accurately predicting which routes are likely to be efficient, the SVM directs the computational resources of GLS towards more fruitful areas of the search space. This focused exploration directly leads to the observed improvements, demonstrating that intelligent ML guidance can significantly boost metaheuristic performance.

The novelty of the framework lies in its synergistic fusion of CP for robust constraint modeling, GLS for iterative improvement, and an SVM for intelligent guidance. The key contributions include demonstrated performance gains: an average reduction of 13.6\% in total travel distance, a 66.9\% improvement in convergence speed, and a high SVM classification accuracy of 94.1\%.

    \item \textbf{Environmental Factors:} Integrating carbon emission constraints for green VRPs represents a crucial future direction \cite{potvin1995genetic}.
\end{itemize}
Ultimately, VRP research is a dynamic, high-impact field with growing social and economic importance. Its continued evolution and integration with advanced AI and optimization techniques underscore its critical and expanding role in contributing to economic efficiency, environmental responsibility, and global social well-being.
